This project and template is base off of [Angela Sheehan's open source LED Butterfly Pop Up Card](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-butterfly-pop-up-card?_ga=1.163351870.304927311.1426541708) and work I did at SparkFun/outreach.

GitHub Robotocat was designed by [jeejkang](https://github.com/jeejkang) . Please note: Even though I work for Microsoft, I didn't get permissions to use this design and meant for teaching purposes only.
